            The assignment for the individual project was to build a modern
            website or web app that would serve as a portfolio for all your
            deliverables for the semester. As we were free in how we approached
            the project, I based the assignment on the following research
            questions:

          <Blockquote>

            With these research questions in mind, the goal was to research and
            design a prototype, test this prototype, then develop it into a live
            high-fidelity website. A more detailed assignment description can be
            found in the{" "}

            The assignment for this project was to aid the Grip On Sound team by
            answering the following research question:

          <Blockquote>
            How can physical exercise teachers in primary school get more

          <P>
            To achieve this, we have to research a concept, and turn this
            concept into visualizations by designing a UI prototype that is
            validated by user tests. Our main focus will be on designing a UI
            for a mobile app. A more detailed assignment description can be

            The assignment for this project was to attend the 2023 Dutch Design
            Week while collaborating with Canadian export students that came to
            visit our school for the week. With the inspiration we gained from
            the DDW, we had to think of a concept within a specific area, in
            this case we chose “product design”, and build a prototype around
            this concept and make a video about it.
          </P>
          <P>
            The main goal of this week was not to create the prototype, but
            moreso explore everything the DDW has to offer and collaborate with
            the Canadian students and meet new people.

            At the start of this project, I wrote a{" "}
            <Link href="/portfolio-project-plan">project plan</Link> to document
            my research questions, form a planning, and have a proper structure

            To answer the sub-question “How can I make sure the portfolio is
            technologically solid?”, I conducted library research (in the form
            of trend analysis and literature study) on{" "}
            <Link href="/web-technologies-research">
              modern web technologies
            </Link>{" "}
            to figure out which technologies I should use to develop the
            portfolio. I felt like a trend analysis is a great way to research
            technologies like these, because the world of technology is always
            changing. Literature study was used to gather insight in which
            technologies are available.

          <P>
            To answer the sub-question “How can I make sure the portfolio is
            easily maintainable when adding new content?”, I conducted library
            research (in the form of an expert interview and literature study)
            on{" "}
            <Link href="/portfolio-content-research">
              different ways to write content for a portfolio
            </Link>
            . The literature study method was used to figure out which
            technologies are available to use, and I chose to conduct an expert
            interview because I knew an expert with first-hand experience with
            all the technologies I found during the literature study research.

            With the technological side of the research done, I still had to
            answer a very important research question: “How can I make sure the
            portfolio is easy to navigate for users?”, which I answered by
            designing wireframes and a UI prototype, and testing it using lab
            and showroom research methods such as A/B testing, peer reviews and
            usability testing. I chose these research methods because it allowed
            me to gather direct feedback from my target audience.
          </P>

            After validating my designs with these tests, I was able to develop
            my prototype into a live website, as documented{" "}
            <Link href="/portfolio-development">here</Link>. To help maintain a
            proper structure, I designed a{" "}

            Throughout this project I communicated with stakeholders and peers
            on how to adapt and improve the portfolio, and reflected on what
            went well or could&apos;ve gone better, which is documented in this{" "}

            assignment (Context, goal, scope, deliverables, products). As a
            group, we brainstormed about which research (sub) questions we
            wanted to tackle.

          <P>
            With our project plan formed, we had to do research on specific sub
            questions to form a better concept before moving on to the designs.
          </P>
          <P>
            My research question was “Are there specific in-app features that
            can help teachers to organize PE classes with behavioural changes to
            decrease noise levels?”. To answer this research question, I
            conducted{" "}

            Because we wanted to visualize our ideas, we decided to each start
            designing our own vision in UI wireframes, so that we could then
            combine our favorite assets from each design into a final version. I
            did this in the form of some{" "}

            To answer the question: “How can we sketch a corporate identity for

            Since we chose product design as a category, we were mainly

            practices, we decided to create a product based on sustainable
            material, ultimately deciding on a shopping bag made of orange peel
            fibers called “bag2nature”.

          <P>
            We brainstormed the concept as a group, and my part in building the
